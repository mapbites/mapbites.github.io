            <p><strong>LEHNERT</strong>, <u>Rudolf</u> Franz: Born: 13.7.1878 in Grossaupa /  NNE Trautenau / Bohemia<br />
  Deceased: 16.1.1948 in Redeyef / Gafsa Oasis / Tunisia <br />
  <strong>LANDROCK</strong>, <u>Ernst</u> Heinrich: Born: 4.8.1878 in Reinsdorf, Saxoni <br />
  Deceased: 30.4.1966 in Kreuzlingen / Constance / Switzerland</p>
            <p align="justify">After travelling through Europe on foot, <strong>Lehnert&rsquo;s</strong> quest for exploration leads  him to Tunisia  in 1903, where he discovers the charms of the Orient. <br />
              Having lived in Tunisia  for one year, <strong>Lehnert</strong> befriends <strong>Landrock</strong>, where their mutual  fascination in Northern Africa develops into a business in Tunisia. <br />
  <strong>Lehnert&rsquo;s</strong> expertise in capturing the essence of the Orient,  through his own artistic interpretations, is materialised through photography  and transferred onto glass. The major body of Lehnert&rsquo;s work can be categorised  into three intertwining North African themes: pristine desert whose undulating  forms are characterised by the contrast of light and shadow; the fertile oasis,  source of life&nbsp;; and the native traditional Tunisian woman, who is the  embodiment of the extreme contrasts of the vastness of the desert and the  contained richness of the oasis.<strong></strong><br />
  <strong>Lehnert</strong> travelled through the desert photographing these  timeless images, returning to Tunis  a master of the print making process gum bichromate, which was very popular in  the 1920&rsquo;s. <strong>Lehnert</strong> and <strong>Landrock</strong> began printing these exotic  oriental images; however, their dream was brutally interrupted with the onset  of World War  I. <strong>Lehnert</strong> and <strong>Landrock</strong> proceeded to move their  business to the heart of Egypt,  Cairo in 1924.</p>
            <p align="justify">The artistic movement in Cairo during this period, focused primarily  on the documentation of ancient monuments<strong>.  Lehnert</strong> longed to return to the charm and serenity of his Arab images;  therefore, he returned 1930 to the country of his dreams in Tunisia, leaving the copyright of his  photographs with <strong>Landrock</strong> in Cairo. The business is  carried on by <strong>Landrock</strong> and later by  his step-son <strong>Kurt Lambelet</strong>. In 1936 a bookshop is opened in the 44 Sherif Street. The shop grows to a  renowned centre for fine art prints and becomes a bookshop with a German and an  English section. </p>
            <p align="justify">After attaining success in Tunis  as a renowned portrait artist, <strong>Lehnert</strong> retired and settled in Redeyef, the main village in the southern oasis of  Gafsa, in his beloved country of Tunisia. </p>
            <p align="justify">After a very long period of oblivion, <strong>Dr. Edouard Lambelet</strong> rediscovered in  1982 the <strong>Lehnert&rsquo;s</strong> glass plates  hidden under a cloud of dust. The revival of Lehnert&rsquo;s work was accelerated  with the help of some enthusiastic fans for <strong><em>black &amp; white photography</em></strong>: <strong>Philippe Cardinal</strong>, a French writer  and journalist, published articles and books. The <strong>Mus&eacute;e de l&rsquo;Elys&eacute;e</strong> in Lausanne / Switzerland,  organized exhibitions thanks to the dedication and efforts of his former  director <strong>Charles-Henri Favrod</strong>. A  young Canadian photographer, <strong>Chris  Langtvet,</strong> who studied in the Fine Arts Department of Concordia University  in Montreal - Canada, rejuvenated from 1998 - 2005 the Lehnert &amp; Landrock  collection to its original state of high quality workmanship. <br />
              Dr. E. Lambelet launched an intensive research on the  collection of some 6500 photos: identification of the pictures and their  dating. He works in close cooperation with <strong>Michel M&eacute;gnin</strong> (France)  who specialized in Lehnert&rsquo;s activities in Tunisia. </p>
            <div align="justify">
              <p>Several  exhibitions have taken place in different cultural centres in Cairo and abroad.</p>

            <p><span class="style2">History of glass</span></p>
            <p align="justify">Lehnert was a gifted photographer; he discovered the charm of the Orient in 1903. A year later, he established in Tunis a company with his friend Landrock. Landrock is a tireless manager; Lehnert&rsquo;s expertise in capturing the essence of the Orient, through his own artistic interpretations, is materialised through photography and transferred onto glass. The major body of Lehnert&rsquo;s work can be categorised into three intertwining North African themes: pristine desert whose undulating forms characterised by the contrast of light and shadow; the fertile oasis, source of life; and the native traditional Tunisian woman, who is the embodiment of the extreme contrasts of the vastness of the desert and the contained richness of the oasis. </p>
            <p align="justify">Lehnert travelled above all through southern Tunisia and across the desert photographing these timeless images. He became a master of the gum bichromate print making process, which became very popular in the 1920&rsquo;s. </p>
            <p align="justify">Their work will be brutally interrupted by World War I, but will pick up again 1924, in Cairo. <br />
              Cairo is different from Tunisia; the photos are an endless documentation of ancient monuments. Lehnert does not feel at home in this noisy metropolis. He is longing for the peacefulness and the charm of the old Arab palaces of Tunis. Lehnert returns to Tunis in 1930. Landrock and his wife remained stuck 1939 in Germany during his holidays, after having sold the bulk of his business to his stepson, Kurt Lambelet. Being a Swiss citizen, Kurt Lambelet succeeds to overcome the storm of the Second World War, but had to adapt to the new constellation by selling also books and coloured postcards. </p>
            <p align="justify">Once, in the early eighties, an Englishman visited the bookshop and introduced himself to my father. He told him that he had been a RAF pilot during World War 2 and had participated in the bombing of Dresden. He had even got the authorisation to drop an egg on the factory for which he was working for during many years. This factory, Nenke und Ostermaier, produced for L &amp; L coloured prints. My father exclaimed then: &laquo;&nbsp;we had there hundreds of glass plates and you blasted them all to dust&nbsp;&raquo;. &laquo;&nbsp;Well, &raquo; replied the former pilot, &laquo;&nbsp;the Germans did exactly the same with my family in Auschwitz&nbsp;&raquo;- My father answered him with deep sadness &laquo;&nbsp;These terrible events produced a complete and senseless loss for everybody...&nbsp;&raquo;.<br />
              Fortunately, Landrock had kept copies of these plates in Cairo. </p>
            <p align="justify">Black and white pictures are getting old fashioned after the war. The glass plates are therefore stored in a corner and will be quickly forgotten, hidden under a cloud of fine Egyptian dust. </p>
            <p align="justify">Dr. Edouard Lambelet will join his father in 1979.</p>
            <p align="justify">1982 - Edouard Lambelet realises that a hidden treasure is waiting to be rediscovered. Photo plates dating back to the beginning of this century had been discarded in some corners of the Lehnert &amp; Landrock bookshop, covered with decades of fine Egyptian dust. </p>
            <p align="justify">1983 - 1984	He cleans and sorts out hundreds of glass plates. They belong to the Tunisian period of Lehnert&rsquo;s activities (mostly from Tunisia, but also from SE Algeria). Most of the plates have the format 18 x 24 cm, some 13 x 18 cm or smaller. An old laboratory and the services of a photographer who used to work in this field when he was young are at his disposition. The production is done under the most archaic conditions, with outdated paper.</p>
            <p align="justify">1984 - Some French clients posted temporarily in Cairo are very enthusiastic about this discovery and do not hesitate to help whenever possible, even when dust and heat become unbearable. In November 1984 Philippe Cardinal, writer and free lance journalist, publishes an article about Lehnert&rsquo;s photos in the French paper Liberation, an article which will inspire many other photo fans.</p>
            <p align="justify">1985 - Many glass plates of the Lehnert&rsquo;s collection are stored in the Mus&eacute;e de l&rsquo;Elys&eacute;e, in Lausanne / Switzerland. <br />

Exhibition organised by the FNAC and the Institut d&rsquo;Orient, starting in Paris and touring several cities of France and Belgium: Lehnert &amp; Landrock, Tunisian Period, 1904 - 1914. The bookshop could re-establish a friendly contact with the daughter of Lehnert thanks to this exhibition: Mme Eliane Bernet was living in Uzes, in the South of France. She realized that very few photos of her father existed. It was her pleasure to hand over to the bookshop a few pictures of Lehnert.</p>
            <p align="justify">1986 - Ph. Cardinal publishes a port-folio Lehnert &amp; Landrock with 16 pictures, printed by the Institut d&rsquo;Orient in Paris, using an old printing technique&nbsp;: phototypie on v&eacute;lin Arches (cotton paper). </p>
            <p align="justify">1987 - 1988 	Identification of the glass plates with the help of a young Dutchman (Chris van Waes), guided by a book published by Lehnert &amp; Landrock in 1924. The identification work will be later confirmed (with few corrections) by Mr. Gabous, a Tunisian writer coming from the south of the country, the adoptive homeland of Lehnert. </p>
            <p align="justify">1987 - Ph. Cardinal publishes the book Lehnert &amp; Landrock, l&rsquo;Orient d&rsquo;un photographe, in Lausanne (Edition Favre) - Switzerland.</p>

            <p align="justify">1997 - Roswitha Lambelet feels that the time has come to open a new Gallery at the Lehnert &amp; Landrock bookshop, in order to boost the selling of Lehnert&rsquo;s photographs. It was named Orient Art Gallery, just to remember the heroic period of the company in Leipzig after the <br />
              1st World War. </p>
            <p align="justify">1998	* 9 - 23 May 1998: Exhibition of Lehnert&rsquo;s Palestine collection in Cairo in the <br />
              Mubarak Library and later in Palestine: Palestine 1923, organized by Pro Helvetia.<br />

            <p align="justify">1999 - * 30.1 - 8.2.&nbsp;: Exhibition in Cairo organised by the Goethe Institute and the Mubarak <br />
              Library held in connection with the Book Fair and with the visit of Prof. Annemarie Schimmel - Egypt, Palestine, Tunisia. Some photos are also exposed at the Goethe Institute.<br />

            <p align="justify">2005 - Since years already, Mr. Michel M&eacute;gnin, a French collector of postcards and engravings got enthusiastic about the work of Lehnert &amp; Landrock. He gathered meticulously an impressive amount of information about Lehnert&rsquo;s work in Tunisia. He published a book to complete his researches: Tunis 1900 - Lehnert &amp; Landrock photographes. </p>
            <p align="justify">This book was published right in time when Lehnert &amp; Landrock celebrated its centennial in the Sony Gallery at the American University in Cairo under the auspices of Prof. S. Abdallah Schleiffer. </p>
            <p align="justify">From now on, events succeed each other naturally: articles in newspapers or studies in specialized magazines, radio or TV interviews, and more books are published. <br />
              We are very happy to notice that our clients are again interested in our old black and white pictures. Photography was for Lehnert a timeless art. A questionable quotation of Lehnert will certainly become true when he predicted that people will still remember his pictures after 200 years.</p></td>
